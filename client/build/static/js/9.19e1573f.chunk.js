Especially as a guitarist. I can also produce 808, 909, and other more modern styles; or go traditional and experimental with more LoFi. I also understand the foundations of blues, rock n roll, country blues, and other classic genres. Also a big fan of music theory and these days instead of just sampling, chopping and sequencing, I'm building my beats and instrumentals from many sources of sound. Then sometimes go back to only an MPC to get that necessary sound. Listen to my catelog.
